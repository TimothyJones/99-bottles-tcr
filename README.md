# TCR (test && commit || revert)

This repository was an exercise run at Everest Engineering, practicing [TCR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFzHOyFeovE).

Code and commit messages collaboratively written by those present at the workshop, using the [99 bottles](https://www.codewars.com/kata/99-bottles-of-beer-1) kata (modified slightly).
